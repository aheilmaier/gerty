Great idea. One feature I've been missing in rancid for a long time is
the possibility to have a "one-stop-shop" for emergency recovery. While
the configuration is saved to CVS, the IOS and other important files
such as "vlan.dat" are missing. It would be great, if this new tool
would include a backup-function for the file-system on the
router/switch, so that it can be fully restored after an emergency
(including all important files).
